But never exponentially.\n\nCorrectness: Software must work correctly. Also non-functional requirements have to be fulfilled.\n\nProduction Efficiency: Naturally finally development time and the softwareâ€™s price are important. And that is higher if the production is not done efficiently.\n\nContinuous Improvement: Improvement requires reflection. By reflecting you recap if solving a certain task was easy or cumbersome. These insights base on reflection.",
